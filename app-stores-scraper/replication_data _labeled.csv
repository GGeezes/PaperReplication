extra extension on file names i.e. 
Normal - vs. - Corrupted  
journal.doc - vs. - journal.doc.date

App appears to be sudo secure, but my dropbox once had documents. They cleaned them out, and I bet they did bypassing your security. They have the GOD Network Admin for pushing out windows updates. You’ll see, if you notice at all, java update lower right corner of your screen. there is some sort of java exploit and everything is vulnerable allowing Java.

Speaking of which; I am amazed and bewildered that company’s put so much money, time, and effort... into building a robust superior application, yet provide inferior support from the app. A simple tagline in users account of the app “Need Support, Report A Bug? Click here” 

BTW Your website is Java coded which I have block on this iPhone, thus not able to contact you through standard procedures.

SO MY QUESTION TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT;
- If I did not delete documents from my account.
- Dropbox did not delete documents from my account.
Q: WHERE DID MY DOCUMENTS GO?
Q: WHY COULDN’T YOU DETECT THE COMPROMISE?
Q: ARE MY DOCUMENTS RETRIEVABLE ON ANY SORT OF BACKUP?
