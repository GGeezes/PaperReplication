Normal - vs. - Corrupted  
journal.doc - vs. - journal.doc.date

App appears to be sudo secure, but my dropbox once had documents. They cleaned them out, and I bet they did bypassing your security. They have the GOD Network Admin for pushing out windows updates. You’ll see, if you notice at all, java update lower right corner of your screen. there is some sort of java exploit and everything is vulnerable allowing Java.

Speaking of which; I am amazed and bewildered that company’s put so much money, time, and effort... into building a robust superior application, yet provide inferior support from the app. A simple tagline in users account of the app “Need Support, Report A Bug? Click here” 

BTW Your website is Java coded which I have block on this iPhone, thus not able to contact you through standard procedures.

SO MY QUESTION TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT;
- If I did not delete documents from my account.
- Dropbox did not delete documents from my account.
Q: WHERE DID MY DOCUMENTS GO?
Q: WHY COULDN’T YOU DETECT THE COMPROMISE?
Q: ARE MY DOCUMENTS RETRIEVABLE ON ANY SORT OF BACKUP?
-? Is there a report showing that their was once documents their??

On your app details below, it shows Premium as $42.99, $44.99, $7.99 but on your website it is $69.99 (or $7.99/mo option). I was charged $69.99 (plus tax) yesterday and then saw the app with $42.99, and had an email from Evernote telling me to save 40% til 7/19 (but no discount code listed and not sure how to get it). Since I purchased it yesterday for $69.99 I was trying to contact customer service to see why the discrepancy between app & website but, as others have mentioned, I didn’t have much luck with Customer Service. There is nowhere (that I can find) to leave a general question and when I select billing, it tells me to contact iTunes re: billing issues since I paid through them. I’m not having billing issues-I just want to know about the prices (which is an Evernote question-not iTunes). Also on the website, FAQ clearly states multiple times that Plus is no longer an option (only Basic, Premium, & Business) yet on your page with different products it still lists Plus as an option.

Right now they’re just ordered alphabetically by title as long as “green” is anywhere in the body.  It’s seriously awful on mobile and I can’t believe this search algorithm was ever approved.

2. They took out the ability to scroll a letter while browsing your notebook, even though this was in a previous version of Evernote.  This is a huge problem if you have a lot of notes in the same notebook.  It means the only fast way to find a note is to use search, which is a lot of extra clicks, and also see #1.

It certainly helps me decide where to go/stay and hopefully I’m helping others as well with mine. That said. You do need to take a page out of yelps book where you can respond as sometimes you have management responses and if I’ve forgotten a certain employee name that did great or not so I’d like the option to respond. Also, YOU NEED TO ALLOW US TO EDIT!!!  Sometimes the place you visit was positive/negative and you review. The next time is the opposite and I’d like to add to my review like yelp allows. Otherwise it’s a great app to help other travelers. Thank You",4,Top contributor,free,NA,NA,npm app-store-scraper
