No real person answered phones.  I left 3 messages, without anyone returning calls.\nI was worried since we had paid in full ($450) when booked (required).\n\nThe 4th time I called, a lady who answered my phone said that she could not retrieve my messages because her boss didn‚Äôt give her the password (?).\n\nPS:  the lack of communication is the reason I only give this trip 4 stars.\n\nFor this 14 hours tour, we were picked up at our hotel at 10:15am promptly, by Dave.  He was the driver and tour guide.\n\nThis is a small group.  We travel in an 8 Passengers van.  The van was ok but due to the road construction/condition and since my husband and I sat at the very last seats, our bodies were ‚Äúrocked and rolled‚Äù üòúüòõ\n\nDave was very good.  He drove very carefully.  He had good experience and knowledge about related things and places.\n\nDuring the trip, Dave explained and/or talked about the local nature, animals and geography where we were going to, the Arctic Circle and Northern Lights.\n\nOne of our stops was the Big Pipelines.   It‚Äôs huge!  Amazing!  \n\nWe made it!  We arrived the Arctic Circle at about 8pm.  What‚Äôs a good feeling!  \n\nThe excitement of dreams coming true is beyond the description of words!\n\nAt 8PM, we still had enough sun light and plenty of time for photos and to enjoy the fresh air.  And of course, Dave helped everyone of us to take photos.  Thanks Dave for always doing extra things to make everyone happy.\n\nOn the way back to Fairbanks, we stopped at a few places to see the Northern Lights.\n\nIt was cloudy so the Aurora wasn‚Äôt very strong as we expected but we were happy enough to see some.\n\nWe knew that it was up to the Mother Nature.  It was not anyone fault üòú\n\nOverall, we‚Äôre so pleased with this tour.\n\nThank you Dave very much for his kindness and extra efforts.  We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre our driver and tourguide! \n\nI highly recommend Dave and this tour with my friends and family as well as everyone who would like to have this tour.

They should be supportive of their top contributors and not blocking them writing more reviews. There is no email, phone number for contact. You can‚Äôt find an answer for your questions on the help center. While (we saw on the press) people are writing fake reviews, to add a listing for a place you like to review it is often blocked by trip advisor with no explication( while that business is listed on google or mentioned on trip advisor over and over again under nearby place listings).

Great for researching restaurants, hotels, points of interest etc. My big complaint is that all restaurants get lumped into the same category regardless of size, scope, level of complexity etc. A small 20 seat luncheon with no alcohol place has no business being compared with a large white tablecloth shop running a much more refined operation complete with full bar and wine service. These are not equivalent and should not be critiqued as the same businesses. Until Trip Advisor starts to distinguish between snack shop, carry out small scale eateries and large refined white table cloth restaurants, I will always have a question about the posted ratings and recommendations.

The app currently does not show the difference which can be vexing. \n2. Another change I would like to see is in the search. Often times i go on here to find food between point a and point b but currently there is not a way to search along that route or slightly off from it. Yes you can go through each address and see but for tourists this can be difficult and additional time to your task. \n\nIt‚Äôs a good time to mention that even if these changes don‚Äôt occur I will keep using the app but it would be nice to see a change to help support those of us with different diets.

We had two butlers who were very caring and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Katerina and the gentlemen that was with her I can‚Äôt remember his name I think it was Nundo were wonderful. The food was delicious and a big variety in the buffet for breakfast and lunch. The restaurants were very good and the people are nice and pleasing. The pool is very clean and workers around the pool are wonderful. We didn‚Äôt have to make any reservations for dinner the butlers did it all for us. Always had clean towels in the rooms and by the pool. We had top shelf alcohol and plenty of it. We didn‚Äôt go in the ocean because there were a lot of sea weeds that was the only thing we didn‚Äôt like about the resort. We will definitely go back.

But let me preference this with saying the food was EXCELLENT!   When I called for reservations I was told there were 34 openings, therefore I requested  a window table for the four of us and was told it‚Äôs a first come first served basis. Figured we‚Äôd be safe getting a window table with that many available seats. Guess not! Our table was in the middle and we got bumped constantly from people walking back to go out for a smoke.   The gentlemen next to us - at a window table - said when called he was told there 24 seats available. Hmmmmm!  \n\nThe service was sub- par.  After all the other tables were asked about beverages and served, we had to flag down a server and ask for ours.   We then asked for paper plates so we could eat the cheese and crackers we ordered along with the bread. At first she said there weren‚Äôt any, then she realized that there were some left over from the lunch cruise and brought 4 over. Seriously! For $57 p/p I don‚Äôt think it would be to much to ask for.  The same with dessert - we had no place to put our cannolis and chocolate covered strawberries while  eating them other than one small corner of the community serving dish. No one even came over to ask if we would like coffee. How could they miss us - we were crammed into the middle of the ‚Äòdining room‚Äô.  When we received our bill - we owed $14.00 for our sodas and ice tea.  We handed the server $25. which she took and came back stating we still owed $14.00. What?!?!?  Ok - it was only an $11 tip but we were not in a restaurant where our order was taken / served and check on to make sure everything was ok.  All the other tables were asked if they would like water - not ours. We were like the forgotten / invisible table.   So she did her job in embarrassing us, so we coughed up another  $15 and handed it to her, very politely when we left.   We are normally far from cheap tippers - we are usually 25% - 30% of the bill - but with no service other than dropping off our pre-ordered meal and not a smile on anyone‚Äôs face -  we did not feel a exorbitant tip was due. \n\nThere were singers in the park that Friday night and as the Capt was giving his boarding instructions they started their songs and no one could hear what he was saying. The dock people were even shaking their heads in disbelief.","rating":4,"reviewer":"Cruising Diva","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"TripAdvisor","id":"3051473234","title":"Love this","comment":"A couple of years ago I started traveling a bit for work and found myself constantly in new areas.

The attention to detail lures you in as you enter your personal slice of peaceful elegance. The natural stone floor leading to the open shower and jacuzzi tub are stunning, flowing into a great room with a king bed, sitting area and a small bar area that looks out into the Pacific Cove. \n\nThe ocean and forrest/jungle views were to die for, and the adjacent pristine pool was a nice touch to the outdoor beauty.\n\nAt times, it felt like we were on set of Zootopia as we listened to a variety of birds singing in harmony with the howler monkeys. Each morning was just majestic as the next!  We loved watching the monkeys , (capuchin, squirrel and howler monkeys) run along the tree branches as they played with each other, and feet away, we witnessed two blue whales dance in the ocean.  Wow- unbelievable!\n\nOverall, Issimo was  a great place to relax, unwind, and enjoy all of the beauty that Manuel Antonio has to offer.  \n\nThe Location: Conveniently located near the beach (beautiful 5 minutes walk through the forest), National park, nice restaurants and shopping for souvenirs!  The hotel provides transportation free of charge to central drop spots , so this is a plus!\n\nThe Hotel: Top notched luxury! The concierge was highly attentive and accommodating. \n\nThe food: Bona-petite- fresh daily, NO complaints, only HAPPY/Satisfied tummiesüòä.   \n\nOverall, our experience was simply amazing! The hotel is beautiful and the entire staff were extremely helpful; especially with our transportation to shopping and excursion experiences. \n\nWe had NO complaints and WILL return because the tranquility, the progressive and inclusiveness this hotel offers is second to none.

Avoid!!!!","rating":5,"reviewer":"corangelo1","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"TripAdvisor","id":"2978779920","title":"Help with trip/food planning","comment":"My hubby and I enjoy riding our motorcycle.

Most of the time I‚Äôm able to write positive reviews but once in awhile have a negative report to share.   I use Trip Advisor a resource for new locations and will likely start booking my trips thru them.    I have seen the Trip Advisor logo all over the world and know it is an important part of marketing their business.","rating":4,"reviewer":"Djpayerle","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"TripAdvisor","id":"2975419518","title":"Great fun on eBikes.","comment":"Great fun!  Jonathon, our guide, was very informative and knowledgeable about the flora and fauna in the area. He said he talks to much, but that is why we are lucky to find and hire guides like him.

While our docent, Michelle, was knowledgeable about the history of the house, we did not enjoy her personal stories. We were there to hear about Houmas House.
