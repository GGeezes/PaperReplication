So far so good. Both could be a little more user friendly but I finally figured it out so I’m good now. I think your website and app comments need to be updated, though. On your app details below, it shows Premium as $42.99, $44.99, $7.99 but on your website it is $69.99 (or $7.99/mo option). I was charged $69.99 (plus tax) yesterday and then saw the app with $42.99, and had an email from Evernote telling me to save 40% til 7/19 (but no discount code listed and not sure how to get it). Since I purchased it yesterday for $69.99 I was trying to contact customer service to see why the discrepancy between app & website but, as others have mentioned, I didn’t have much luck with Customer Service. There is nowhere (that I can find) to leave a general question and when I select billing, it tells me to contact iTunes re: billing issues since I paid through them. I’m not having billing issues-I just want to know about the prices (which is an Evernote question-not iTunes). Also on the website, FAQ clearly states multiple times that Plus is no longer an option (only Basic, Premium, & Business) yet on your page with different products it still lists Plus as an option. As big a name as Evernote is, it’s surprising that there are several inconsistencies and you can’t get through to anyone easier.

The search is HORRIBLE.  They need to use the same relevance algorithm that is currently in the desktop version.  If I search for “green,” the notes with green in the title should be at the top, then the notes with green in the body.  Right now they’re just ordered alphabetically by title as long as “green” is anywhere in the body.  It’s seriously awful on mobile and I can’t believe this search algorithm was ever approved.\n\n2. They took out the ability to scroll a letter while browsing your notebook, even though this was in a previous version of Evernote.  This is a huge problem if you have a lot of notes in the same notebook.  It means the only fast way to find a note is to use search, which is a lot of extra clicks, and also see #1.\n\n3.  When using snippet view, scrolling is terrible through a large notebook.  You scroll to a note, find it, tap it, then all the snippets load and it randomly scrolls you to somewhere completely different without opening with the note you clicked.  Unbelievably bad.","rating":2,"reviewer":"Jorge jorgeson","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"Evernote","id":"3004365722","title":"In love","comment":"I have been using Evernote for years, for everything from writing my life journal, to recording songs and writing lyrics. \n\nIt is beautiful and simple.\n\nThe more that I study software the more inspiring this app becomes because it does so much yet keeps its intuitiveness.\n\nThank you for your work.","rating":5,"reviewer":"Bruce the Mormon","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"Evernote","id":"3309734966","title":"I can’t understand the in-app purchases","comment":"So when I log into my Evernote free account, it asks me to upgrade, but it doesn’t tell me the options or cost.

Things  change, people leave, corrections are made .\n\nWe use this in our travels primarily for restaurants and  places to stay.  Glad we see the good bad and ugly.  However reviews should be purged after 12-15 months to keep out the old ratings.  Have seen reviews going back to 2008 which makes no sense due to being relevant\nThis has been my review for couple years.  Need to purge old reviews as they have zero meaning as out of date. Today actually saw a review for 2007","rating":4,"reviewer":"Emahiserj","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"TripAdvisor","id":"3151656739","title":"تطبيق رائع وجميل","comment":"تطبيق اقل مايقال عنه انه مساعد لأي مسافر بكل اللغات والمهام ، اصبح التطبيق يدعم اللغة العربية وهذا شيء انتظرناه كثيراً .. نطمع في المزيد","rating":5,"reviewer":"ALI-alwadee","fee":"free","date":"NA","version":"114.2","data source":"npm app-store-scraper"},{"app":"TripAdvisor","id":"3153664500","title":"Love the trip advisor app","comment":"This app has helped us so much when we travel.

It certainly helps me decide where to go/stay and hopefully I’m helping others as well with mine. That said. You do need to take a page out of yelps book where you can respond as sometimes you have management responses and if I’ve forgotten a certain employee name that did great or not so I’d like the option to respond. Also, YOU NEED TO ALLOW US TO EDIT!!!  Sometimes the place you visit was positive/negative and you review. The next time is the opposite and I’d like to add to my review like yelp allows. Otherwise it’s a great app to help other travelers.
